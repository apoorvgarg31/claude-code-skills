## Classification Tips

1. **Check headers first** — Most documents have clear type indicators in the header
2. **Look for form numbers** — AIA G702, G703, WH-347, ACORD 25
3. **Vendor name placement** — Invoices have vendor at top, waivers have vendor in body
4. **Signatures and notary stamps** — Indicate legal documents (waivers, affidavits)
5. **Table structure** — SOV has specific column structure; payroll has employee data
6. **Page continuations** — Multi-page docs often have "Page X of Y" or continuation headers
7. **When documents are grouped** — Vendors typically submit: invoice + lien waiver as a set
